# Why, hello there!

Welcome to KWoC '17. A lot has already been said and written about why participating in KWoC is already a great step in your path to Open Source Development. In this document, I'll try to list below everything I plan to cover **with your help** as part of KWoC '17.

## Project scope
The goal of this project would be to use Facebook's graph API to fetch all the latest songs posted to the Facebook group Listen To This KGP and link them with proper metadata from one of the popular public music metadata APIs like Musixmatch. Once fetched, all this information is to be properly stored in a database for later access from APIs and for running machine learning models to identify listening trends, clustering users and giving recommendations.

## Technical know-how
There are no prerequisites per se. You'll be learning about working with public REST APIs, writing utility scripts, database theory (how to best store information) & implementation and if time permits, caching and some hands-on basic machine learning.

## Roadmap for KWoC
- Decide the schema for storing all the data
- Writing the main script to use the graph API to continuously fetch information from the Facebook group.
- Write a utility script to fetch music metadata from Musixmatch API
- Write a script that maintains a dynamic list of trending songs / posts / users.
- Write models to analyze listening trends of different users and for creating recommendations.

## About me
I am Naresh, 5th year dual degree student, department of Computer Science, IITKGP. Most of my work has been in Javascript, Python and C++ and would be glad to guide you wherever needed, hoping you'll put in just as much effort.

## Still interested?
Great! Reach out to me through email (ghostwriternr@gmail.com) or via Slack (https://slack.metakgp.org/). I try to reply as soon as possible.

Happy coding!
